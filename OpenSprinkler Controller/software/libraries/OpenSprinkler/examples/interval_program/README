====== Update ======

* August 14, 2012

- Added support for RTC (OPTION_USE_RTC is functioning now). Enabling this option requires DS1307 RTC. OpenSprinkler 1.4 and above have built-in DS1307. Previous versions require external RTC module (connection from RTC to controller: Vcc->Vin(+5V), Gnd->Gnd, SDA->SDA, SCL->SCL).
- Split long program data into subsections to support a large number of programs.
- A couple of changes to increase the robustness of EEPROM read and valve control.

* June 19, 2012

First version of the new interval program. A number of new features have been added, including
- Program-based scheduling. Each program can specify an independent set of days (weekdays or interval days), set of stations, start time, end time, interval, and water time. Currently up to 64 programs are supported.
- Choice between running program schedules sequentially or in parallel (by setting the 'Sequential' option value)
- A graphical preview feature, which allows visualizing the schedule of each day.
- Support for manual mode. In manual mode, each station can be independently turned on or off through a button control interface. An optional timer can be set to allow station to turn off after a specified amount of time.
