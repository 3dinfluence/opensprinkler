====== IMPORTANT ======
Note: the sub-folders correspond to different OpenSprinkler hardware verions (1.0, 1.1...). Please use the folder that matches your hardware version. To find which hardware version you have:

* If your OpenSprinkler comes with a transparent plastic enclosure, the hardware version is printed on the silkscreen close to the top of the circuit board. For example, OpenSprinkler v1.4s.

* If your OpenSprinkler comes with injection-molded white enclosure:
  * If the 24VAC terminal block (on the left side of the controller) is green colored, then you have hardware v2.0
  * If the 24VAC terminal block (on the left side of the controller) is oranged colored, then you have hardware v2.1
  
  Alternatively, you can also open the enclosure and find the hardware version as printed on the silkscreen close to the top of the circuit board.

*DO NOT* download .hex files directly from GitHub page by using 'Save File As...' or 'Save Link As...'. Instead, download the entire package as a zip file, or alternatively download individual files using the 'Raw' link.
